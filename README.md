## Hi there 👋
I’m Skafti from Iceland, and I am looking for work! I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like Python and Flutter.
- 👀 I’m interested in Flutter, React and Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, "The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021", which is a 100 days of code course on udemy. In other words, 100 projects to my porfolio all in Python!
      I consistently tweet about my progress. You can check it out at twitter.com/skaftisveins.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really
